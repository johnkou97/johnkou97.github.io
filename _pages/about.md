I am a graduate student researcher in Astronomy and Data Science at Leiden University and a member of the [Leiden Observatory](https://local.strw.leidenuniv.nl/). I am currently working on my MSc thesis on the topic of "A cross-power model for power suppression in FLAMINGO". My previous research project in Leiden was on the topic of "Finding the best exoplanets to search for exomoons by radial velocity".
  
I obtained my BSc in Physics from the [Aristotle University of Thessaloniki](https://www.auth.gr/en) in 2020. I was a part of the [Gravitational Waves Group](https://niksterg.github.io/gw-group/) of the [Section of Astrophysics, Astronomy and Mechanics](https://www.astro.auth.gr/n/), where I worked on the topic of "Spectral Classification of Neutron Star Post-Merger Gravitational Wave Emission".
  
My other interests include Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Statistics and much more. I am currently working on a project on the topic of "Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Optics and Exoplanet Imaging". The public repository of the project can be found [here](https://github.com/johnkou97/AdaptiveOptics). I am also a big fan of Linux and open-source software. I have worked on many projects in the past, some as a part of my studies and some as a hobby.
