Welcome! I am a graduate of the [M.Sc. in Astronomy and Data Science](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/education/study-programmes/master/astronomy/astronomy-and-data-science) program at [Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en). My academic and research journey has been deeply rooted in exploring the intersections of astrophysics, machine learning, and data science.

During my M.Sc., I contributed to a variety of research projects tackling complex challenges in both astronomy and data science. My Master's thesis, [“A Cross-Power Model for Power Suppression in FLAMINGO”](/projects/FLAMINGO/), involved advanced modeling techniques applied to large-scale simulations. Earlier, I explored planetary science through my first-year thesis, [“Finding the Best Exoplanets to Search for Exomoons by Radial Velocity”](/projects/exomoons/). Additionally, I ventured into artificial intelligence with a project on [“Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Optics and Exoplanet Imaging”](/projects/RLAdaptive/).

Prior to my Master's studies, I earned a [B.Sc. in Physics](https://www.physics.auth.gr/en/) from [Aristotle University of Thessaloniki](https://www.auth.gr/en), where I joined the [Gravitational Waves Group](https://niksterg.github.io/gw-group/) My undergraduate thesis, [“Spectral Classification of Neutron Star Post-Merger Gravitational Wave Emission”](/projects/spectral/), sparked my fascination with the applications of AI in astrophysics. Following graduation, I continued collaborating with the group as a research assistant, culminating in our publication, [“Predicting Binary Neutron Star Postmerger Spectra Using Artificial Neural Networks”](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024PhRvD.110f3008P), in Physical Review D.

Beyond academia, I am passionate about data science, machine and deep learning, reinforcement learning, and statistics. Many of my projects in these fields have been driven by curiosity and a desire to solve practical problems. You can explore some of them on my [projects page](/projects).

I am also an advocate for Linux and open-source software, driven by a belief in the power of collaboration and openness to advance knowledge and technology. Always eager to learn, grow, and tackle new challenges, I would love to connect and collaborate on exciting ideas or projects. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss anything!
