I have participated in four Kaggle challenges so far. My participation in the challenge [Predict Future Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales) was part of the Data Mining course and is described in the [Data Mining](/projects/DataMining) project. The challenge [G2Net-Hackathon](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/g2net-hackathon) is described in the [Gravitational Wave Hackathon](/projects/GW_hackathon) project. The other two challenges are described below.
