This project started as part of the course "Seminar Advanced Reinforcement Learning" at Leiden University. You can find the final report [here](/assets/pdf/RLAdaptive.pdf). The code is open-source and available on my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/johnkou97/AdaptiveOptics).

We have presented the project at the [BNAIC/BeNeLearn 2024](https://bnaic2024.sites.uu.nl/) conference with a poster. See the pictures below! You can also find the poster in [pdf format](/assets/pdf/RL_poster.pdf).
