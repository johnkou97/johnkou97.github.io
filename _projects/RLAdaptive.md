This project started as part of the course "Seminar Advanced Reinforcement Learning" at Leiden University. You can find the final report [here](/assets/pdf/RLAdaptive.pdf). The code is open-source and available on my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/johnkou97/AdaptiveOptics).

We will present the project in the upcoming [BNAIC/BeNeLearn 2024](https://bnaic2024.sites.uu.nl/) conference with a poster. Stay tuned for more updates!
