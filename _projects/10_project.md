# Gravitational Wave Hackathon

I have had the pleasure to participate in two hackathons related to gravitational waves as part of the workshops organized by the [network for Gravitational Waves, Geophysics and Machine Learning (G2Net)](https://www.g2net.eu/). The first one was in Malta in 2020 where I participated in person and the second one was in Thessaloniki in 2023 where I participated remotely. The hackathons were a great opportunity to learn more about the field of gravitational waves and machine learning, and to meet other researchers in the field.

## Malta 2020

The data used for the challenge contains earthquake from all over the world, together with noise (non-earthquake ambient noise). Earthquakes are very similar to gravitational waves, and in this context, have no meaningful difference. The goal of this challenge is to correctly classify an unknown set of data using any model that was trained on a provided dataset where the correct labels are provided.
