As part of my graduate and undergraduate studies, I have completed various projects as part of my coursework. In this page, I present some of the projects that I have completed in the fields of astronomy, astrophysics, and mathematics. These projects include the analysis of astronomical data, the development of computational models, and the application of mathematical techniques to solve astrophysical problems.

## Matched Filtering in Gravitational Wave Data Analysis

This small project was part of the course "Astrostastistics" at the Leiden Observatory. The project consisted of implementing a matched filtering algorithm to detect gravitational wave signals in noisy data. The data used in this project were synthetic, and the templates used the approximations described by the VIRGO and LIGO collaborations {% cite 2017AnP...52900209A --file external %}
