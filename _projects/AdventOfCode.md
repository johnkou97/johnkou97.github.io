In December 2024, I decided to participate in the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge. The Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language. The challenge is organized by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl) and has been running since 2015. The puzzles are released daily at midnight Eastern Time (05:00 UTC) from December 1st to December 25th. Each puzzle has two parts, and the difficulty increases as the days go by.
